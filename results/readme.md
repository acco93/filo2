This directory contains computational results of [FILO](filo/) and [FILO2](filo2/), as well as the [best known solutions](i-bks/) we found during our entire experimentation for the new I instances. 

For each algorithm, there are results associated with short and long runs. 
Moreover, for each instance and seed, there is `.out` file containing the solution value and the computing time in seconds and `.sol` containing the solution representation.

Results are also available in [csv format](csvs/):
- FILO: [x](csvs/filo-x.csv), [x-long](csvs/filo-x-long.csv), [b](csvs/filo-b.csv), [b-long](csvs/filo-b-long.csv)
- FILO2: [x](csvs/filo2-x.csv), [x-long](csvs/filo2-x-long.csv), [b](csvs/filo2-b.csv), [b-long](csvs/filo2-b-long.csv), [i](csvs/filo2-i.csv), [i-long](csvs/filo2-i-long.csv)
